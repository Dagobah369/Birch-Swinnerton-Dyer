Abstract

This manuscript presents a proof of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture,
establishing the equivalence between the analytic rank of an elliptic curve
E/Q and the algebraic rank of its Mordell-Weil group. Our approach relies on the
spectral coherence coefficient (C10 ≈ 0.9), a universal statistical invariant established
in [1]. We transpose this invariant to the zeros of the L-function L(E, s) on
the critical line, normalized by the local spectral density (analogous to the Riemannvon
Mangoldt formula). The proof is structured around three analytic bridges:
• (A) Detection: We demonstrate that a rank mismatch (ran > ralg) creates
a "spectral clustering" of zeros at s = 1 without geometric support. This
anomaly induces long-range correlations in the spectral gaps, generating a
measurable positive signature (ϵ > 0) in the variance of the coherence coefficient.
• (B) Exclusion: Using the Gross-Zagier formula and the positivity of the
Néron-Tate canonical height, we prove that the geometric structure of the
curve imposes strict spectral rigidity, forcing ϵ = 0.
• (C) Construction: We identify the "Arithmetic Laplacian" via the Hecke
operator acting on the Hilbert space of modular forms, whose discrete rational
spectrum stabilizes the system.
The logical contradiction between the spectral disorder of "ghost zeros" (ϵ > 0) and
the geometric rigidity (ϵ = 0) forces the ranks to align and implies the finiteness of
the Tate-Shafarevich group.
